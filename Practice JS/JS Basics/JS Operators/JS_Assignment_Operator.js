    JavaScript Assignment Operators
    JavaScript assignment operator is equal (=) which assigns the value of the right-hand operand 
    to its left-hand operand. That is if a = b assigns the value of b to a.

    The simple assignment operator is used to assign a value to a variable. The assignment operation
    evaluates the assigned value. Chaining the assignment operator is possible in order to assign a 
    single value to multiple variables.
