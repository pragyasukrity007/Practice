/*
    OPERATOR NAME___________________USAGE_________OPERATION
    Equality Operator_______________a == b________Compares the equality of two operators
    Inequality Operator_____________a != b________Compares inequality of two operators
    Strict Equality Operator________a === b_______Compares both value and type of the operand
    Strict Inequality Operator______a !== b_______Compares inequality with type
    Greater than Operator___________a > b_________Checks if the left operator is greater than the right operator
    Greater than or equal Operator__a >= b________Checks if the left operator is greater than or equal to the right operator
    Less than Operator______________a < b_________Checks if the left operator is smaller than the right operator
    Less than or equal Operator_____a <= b________Checks if the left operator is smaller than or equal to the right operator
