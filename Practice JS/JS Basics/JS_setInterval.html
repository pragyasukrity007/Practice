      JavaScript SetTimeout and SetInterval are the only native function in
      JavaScript that is used to run code asynchronously, it means allowing the
      function to be executed immediately, there is no need to wait for the

      JavaScript setInterval() Method: The setInterval() method repeats a given
      function at every given time interval.

      Since the setInterval() method executes the function infinitely hence
      there is a method called as clearInterval() to stop the execution of the
      setInterval().
