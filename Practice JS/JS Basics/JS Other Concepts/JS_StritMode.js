Strict mode in JavaScript

Strict Mode was a new feature in ECMAScript 5 that allows you to place a program, or 
a function, in a “strict” operating context. This strict context prevents certain actions 
from being taken and throws more exceptions. The statement “use strict”; instructs the 
browser to use the Strict mode, which is a reduced and safer feature set of JavaScript.



Benefits of using Strict Mode:
- Strict mode eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.

- Strict mode fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform 
optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code 
that’s not strict mode.

- Strict mode prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.

- It prevents, or throws errors, when relatively “unsafe” actions are taken (such as gaining 
access to the global object).

- It disables features that are confusing or poorly thought out.

- Strict mode makes it easier to write “secure” JavaScript.
