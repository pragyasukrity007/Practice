    JavaScript Syntax is used to define the set of rules to construct a JavaScript code.

/*
    JavaScript Variables
    A JavaScript variable is the simple name of the storage location where data is stored. 
    There are two types of variables in JavaScript. 

    Local variables: Declare a variable inside of a block or function.
    Global variables: Declare a variable outside function or within a window object.

/*
    JavaScript Operators
    JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to compute the value or in other words, 
    we can perform operations on operands. 

    Arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, / ) are used to compute the value, and 
    Assignment operators ( =, +=, %= ) are used to assign the values to variables.
*/

/*
    JavaScript Expression
    Expression is the combination of values, operators, and variables. 
    It is used to compute the values.
*/
// Variable Declarations
let x, num, sum;

// Assign value to the variables
x = 20;
y = 30;

// Expression to divide a number
num = x / 2;

// Expression to add two numbers
sum = x + y;

console.log(num + "<br>" + sum);

/*
    JavaScript Keyword
    The keywords are the reserved words that have special meanings in JavaScript. 
*/

/*
    JavaScript Comments
    The comments are ignored by the JavaScript compiler.  It increases the readability of code. 
    Anything written after double slashes // (single-line comment)

    Also (multi-line comment) is treated as a comment and ignored by the JavaScript compiler. 

    These lines are written between multi-line comments
*/

/*
    JavaScript Data Types
    JavaScript provides different datatypes to hold different values on variables. 
    JavaScript is a dynamic programming language, which means do not need to specify the 
    type of variable.
    
    There are two types of data types in JavaScript. 
    1. Primitive data type
    2. Non-primitive (reference) data type
*/

/*
    JavaScript Functions
    JavaScript functions are the blocks of code used to perform some particular operations.
    JavaScript function is executed when something calls it. 
    It can be called many times so the function is reusable.

    The JavaScript function can contain zero or more arguments.
