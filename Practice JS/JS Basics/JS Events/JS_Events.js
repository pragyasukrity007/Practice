JavaScript Events

Javascript has events to provide a dynamic interface to a webpage. 
These events are hooked to elements in the Document Object Model(DOM). 
These events by default use bubbling propagation i.e, upwards in the DOM from 
children to parent. We can bind events either as inline or in an external script.

/*
Some JavaScript Events

1. onclick event
2. onkeyup event
3. onmouseover event
4. onmouseout event
5. onchange event
6. onload event
7. onfocus event
8. onblur event

JavaScript onmouseup event listens to left and middle mouse clicks, but onmousedown event 
listens to left, middle, and right mouse clicks whereas onclick only handles left clicks.
