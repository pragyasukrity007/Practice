/*
JavaScript Events

Javascript has events to provide a dynamic interface to a webpage. 
These events are hooked to elements in the Document Object Model(DOM). 
These events by default use bubbling propagation i.e, upwards in the DOM from 
children to parent. We can bind events either as inline or in an external script.
